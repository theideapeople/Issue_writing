# Writing a helpful issue report or feature request.

This is a guide to help you resolve a problem or submit something you would like added to your program.

There are two aspects to fixing a bug or submitting a feature request that will help the user and the support agent get on the same page:

## A Clear Title

Writing a clear title of your issue or feature seems obvious but can be overlooked.  It is the first thing that everyone will notice and you want to get their attention.  That is why you are submitting right?

*Examples of poor titles:*
* "HELP!!1"
* "Broken"
* "Lame, this program sux"



## One Issue or Request per Report

## Steps to Repeat Issue

## Expected and observed results

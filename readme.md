# Writing a helpful issue report or feature request.

This is a guide to help you submit an issue report or feature request.  Writing a well constructed report will help the administrators fix your issue and improve the quality of the application.

There are two aspects to fixing a bug or submitting a feature request that will help the user and the support agent get on the same page:

* __From your point of view:__ You have to understand that person helping you most likely is not aware of the problem, otherwise it would be fixed.  The more you can help them understand your issue in a calm and helpful manner will go a long way.

* __From their point of view:__ They are trying to use your software and either they can't or it is missing a feature that will help them.  Instead of just working around it, they are helping you do your job.  Listen.  Be thoughtful.  At this point they are almost an employee. 

## A Clear Title

Writing a clear title of your issue or feature seems obvious but can be overlooked.  It is the first thing that everyone will notice and you want to get their attention.  That is why you are submitting right?

*Examples of poor titles:*
* "HELP!!1"
* "Broken"
* "Lame, this program sux"

*Examples of good titles:*
* "Unable to save a contact to my contact list."
* "I click on a link to take me to my project but it says it cannot be found."
* "I am not able to upload an image to my profile."

## One Issue or Request per Report

In order for the support staff to give you the best service only include one issue per report.  Dealing with multiple issues in one ticket greatly increases the chances that issues will be missed.

## Steps to Repeat Issue

An important step in helping the support staff fix your issue is being able to repeat the steps you took that caused the problem.  It is okay if you don't remember every step in perfect deftail.  It is important to let the support staff you do recall so they can best help you.
